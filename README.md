# LEV Test Application

This web application connects with **Spotify public API**, and is able to show current song information (*if it is being played*).
It is possible to create playlists, which are persisted in local browser (not in Spotify)

## Running application

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

Enjoy!
